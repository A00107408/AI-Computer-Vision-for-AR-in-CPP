# AI Computer Vision for AR in CPP
A C++ project for training AI models on Yann LeCun's MNIST handwritten digits data set: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

to run, add train-images.idx3-ubyte and train-labels.idx1-ubyte binary files into the root project directory (they are too big to add to the repo).

C++ pointers provide an efficient way of dealing with large data sets without the need for duplication.
The goal is to integrate this application with AR
