# AI Computer Vision for AR in CPP
A C++ project for training AI models on Yann LeCun's MNIST handwritten digits data set: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

TO RUN: Add train-images.idx3-ubyte and train-labels.idx1-ubyte binary files into the root project directory. Comment out (or in) the different main() functions to test the prediction performance of the various models eg; multi-layer perceptron with back propagation, KMeans, KNN etc.
